\title{Retrieve IUCN Red List Assessments from URLs}
\usage{
rl_from_url(urls, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{urls}{Character vector. A vector of URLs pointing to specific IUCN Red List species assessments.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If TRUE, prints progress messages for each assessment being retrieved. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A data frame combining all the species assessment data retrieved, with the same fields as
\code{\link[=rl_from_assessment_id]{rl_from_assessment_id()}}.
}
\description{
This function retrieves one or multiple IUCN Red List species assessments from their URL. The assessment ID
is extracted from the URL.
}
\details{
The function parses each URL to extract the assessment ID, then calls \code{rl_from_assessment_id} for each
ID to fetch and compile assessment data. A one-second delay is added between API calls to avoid rate-limiting.
}
\note{
Requires an IUCN Red List API token to be set as an environment variable under \code{redlist_api}.

  # Retrieve multiple assessments using a vector of URLs

            "https://api.iucnredlist.org/api/v4/assessment/7654321")
  rl_from_url(urls)
