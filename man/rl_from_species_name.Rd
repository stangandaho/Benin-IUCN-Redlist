\title{Retrieve IUCN Red List Assessments by Species Name}
\usage{
rl_from_species_name(scientific_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{scientific_name}{Character. The scientific name of the species (e.g., "Panthera leo").}
}
\value{
A data frame with detailed assessment information for the species, including:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Taxonomic information}: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and scientific name
\item \strong{Assessment details}: assessment date, criteria, Red List category, population trends
\item \strong{Population and habitat details}: population size, trends, habitat description
\item \strong{Threats and conservation measures}: major threats, conservation actions, and documentation
}
}
\description{
This function retrieves assessment information from the IUCN Red List API for a specified species
using its scientific name. The function fetches taxonomic, population, conservation, and threat data
for each assessment related to the species.
}
\details{
The function first splits the \code{scientific_name} into genus and species components (with support for
infra-specific names if available) and then calls the IUCN API to retrieve the associated assessment
data. If multiple assessments exist for the species, they are all fetched and combined into a
single data frame.
}
\note{
Requires an IUCN Red List API token to be set as an environment variable under \code{redlist_api}.
Additionally, a helper function, \code{rl_check_api()}, should be defined to check the API connection.
